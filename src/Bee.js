// Create a Bee class, in pseudoclassical style, with:
//  call the Grub superclass
//  set the prototype
//  set the constructor
//  an age property that is set to 5
//  a color property that is set to yellow
//  a food property that is inherited from grub
//  an eat method that is inherited from grub
//  a job property that is set to keep on growing
